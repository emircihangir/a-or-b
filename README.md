# a-or-b

## What is it?

a-or-b is an image recognition model that is able to recognize the letter a from b. It tries to answer the question "is this letter a or b?".

## How does it work?

It uses a convolutional neural network to process images, then plots a graph to reveal its answer.

## How to use it?

Place an image with the name "input.png" in the root directory, and execute the cells in the "aORb_FINAL.ipynb" file. The model will output a graph of its decision. The blue dot in the graph represents the model's answer, and how sure it is. The closer to either choice, the more certain the model is.
